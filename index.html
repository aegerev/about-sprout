      <h1>Education And the Community Are Our Top Priority.</h1>
      <p>"You make this day (and every day) a special day, by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you just the way you are."<br/>
          -Fred Rogers, also known as "Mister Rogers"</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Your Success Is Our Mission. We Exist Thanks To You.</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Sprout is all about one thing: making sure that your child succeeds. As the number one educational media brand for kids, Sprout helps people of any age, gender, or race to succeed in life. That is our mission. Through curriculum-based media and community-based programs, Sprout wants people to see themselves uniquely reflected and celebrated in lovable, diverse characters who serve as positive role models. Sprout also want people - be it kids or adults -  to explore their feelings and discover new adventures along the way.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Role Models In Every Way.</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Other kids' channels have TV shows that are not educational at all. In fact, they're the OPPOSITE of educational. They have TV hosts who just serve up content, and then introduce the show, only to go into ads. 
                <br/>

                NOT HERE. 

                <br/>

                Instead of hosts and ads, we have 1000% curriculum-based content, with characters that serve as role models for ALL generations. From the Kratt Brothers to Mister Rogers, and everything (and everyone) in between, we know that we're doing this the right way. This is all thanks to our trademarked "No Hosts, No Ads" campaign.

                <h2 class="card-title">Old Friends, New Friends</h2>

                <p>In addition to your favorites, we also brought in some new friends - the KikOriki Crew, Ariel, Eric, Melody, Coral, and the rest of Atlantica/New Atlantica, Jim Cramer from "Mad Money w/Jim Cramer", Marcus Lemonis from "The Profit"/"The Partner"... what else can we say? 

                    <br/>

                    All of them are right here, waiting for you.

            <h2 class="card-title">The Foundation To Build Your English.</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Everything needs a foundation. Without it, everything crumbles, everything falls apart.
                <br/>

                Imagine a house. Without the proper foundation, without the proper support, that house will fall.
                <br/>

                The same is true for education. If there is no foundation, there's no success.
                <br/>

                You can try out every single program to speak English, but the truth is that not all programs will give you the foundation needed to succeed.
                <br/>

                That's where Sprout's ENG-1000 program comes in.
                
               With this program, we will be working on building the foundation for you to succeed in learning or advancing your English, which will help you succeed in life!
